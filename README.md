# NBA-draft-Project

In this project I will try and predict the amount of shared wins (a statistical measurement that attempts to enumerate a single player contribution to a team success as a whole) for each player.

##Background - What is the NBA Draft ?
In the beginning of every season, the NBA Teams (The National Basketball association in America) select players to joing to their lineup and play under their name and uniform. That process is called the NBA Draft.

The Order of selection is importent, whereas the players that would be regarded as "Top" or "Elite" Players would tend to select in the early stages of the Draft. for Example, Lebron James and Shaquille O'neal were selected in the first pick in thire respective drafts (2003 and 1992).
Shared wins is a major factor to player drafting Pick position and in this project I will try to predict it based on data I scraped from the last 40 years of the Draft.

[edit ! so far I managed to complete only the Visualization and Scraping portions of the project]
